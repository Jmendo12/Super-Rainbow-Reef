Super Rainbow Reef is an offline game I developed with a partner in Spring of 2018 for a software Development course.
The game is a simple brick-breaker, where breaking points and defeating Octopus, or 'Big Legs' rewards the player
with points or power-ups. There are three levels, and to progress between levels are Octupus on a level must be
defeated.

The game is written in Java, following the now deprecated observer pattern, the runnable interface, and swing for
graphics. The game's classes are written following an object-oriented design. Reviewing the code now, in July of 2019
I've noticed that there are many areas where the code could be greatly improved; there are large functions that could
be broken into smaller functions, classes that are not as cohesive as one would like, and objects that could be fit
into more appropriate data structures. Regardless, I have uploaded the code to show as part of my portfolio, and to
serve as I reminder of where I have came from, what I have learned, and that I have much, much more to learn. Thanks
for taking the time to read this, and enjoy yourself out on the reef.
